Hackathon Instructions
======================

Goal: Build a generative-AI agent (or agent pipeline) that can perform ETL from the provided source CSVs into the target BigQuery schema, including:
- schema discovery and mapping
- validation rules enforcement and error handling
- transformations and aggregations for reporting
- idempotent loads and lineage tracking
- automated tests and sample assertions

Starter ideas (challenge tiers):
- Bronze: Implement a basic agent that reads CSVs, validates schema, and loads into BigQuery tables using the provided DDL.
- Silver: Add automatic deduplication, type coercion, and validation reports saved to a 'staging_errors' table.
- Gold: Implement automatic anomaly detection on numeric indicators and suggest corrective transformations using explainable steps.
- Platinum: Build an agent that auto-generates SQL transformations and implements CI/CD integration to run on new CSV arrivals.
